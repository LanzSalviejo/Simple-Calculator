Criteria of the program:

Write a program that will act as a simple calculator and perform basic mathematical functions between two
numbers (double) and display the result (double):
      • The calculator will support the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power
      • The user will be prompted to enter an expression which will be two numbers separated by an operator
            o NOTE: A space must separate the number and the operator
      • Valid operators include:
            o “*” or “x” or “X” for multiply
            o “/” for divide
            o “+” for add
            o “-“ for subtract
            o “^” for power
      • Here are some valid examples:
            o Multiplication: 3.2 * 5.1 or 3.2 x 5.1 or 3.2 X 5.1
            o Division: -9.7 / 3
            o Addition: 8 + -5
            o Subtraction: 12.3 - -5.9
            o Power: 5 ^ 2
